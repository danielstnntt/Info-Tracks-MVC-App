# Info-Tracks-MVC-App

This is an MVC application that uses google to checks how many times infotracks is flaged based on the user's search criteria. 
It accepts a search criteria and search engine as the parameters (so far, it only works for www.google.co.uk).

I spend no more than 3 hours on this app as it was mentioned in the spec but if I had more time to complete this, I would have done the following:

> Add a relational SQL database to save the user search queries and results.
> Added other search engines to the front end like bing, yahoo etc
> Log activities so if any errors occurred, it would be logged.
> Create a history page so the user can see their searches from the past.

Use case:
1. Enter "infotracks" in the keyword field and "www.google.co.uk" in the search engine field and it populated the results section.
2. Enter "fdsdfgfg" in the keyword field and "www.google.co.uk" in the search engine field and no results were populated in the results section.
